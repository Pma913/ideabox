### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
For the individual who has too many ideas and no where to store them, Ideabox is the solution! When the user has an idea, they use the application's form to title and describe their idea. Once saved, the idea (and subsequent) will populate an area below. The user can favorite their ideas by clicking on the idea's "star" button, and even filter their perspective to only see ideas that contain a star. If the user has too many ideas and wants to locate one, there is a third input field that will filter the displayed ideas based on the search input.

### Installation Instructions:

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This is our first group project. We are in the fourth week of the Turing Front End software development program. This project took roughly 25 hours to complete.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using a class) and DOM model
Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP

This project demonstrates our precise ablity to match a given comp with HTML and CSS styling. Contains a seperate JavaScript data model that collabprates with the DOM for concise, dynamic code. Functions have been refactored to be succint and improve readability. 

### Wins + Challenges:
